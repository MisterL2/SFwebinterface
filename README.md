# SFwebinterface
Web Interface for a SpongeForge Minecraft server, allowing external applications to communicate with the gameserver

# IMPORTANT
The plugin makes every attempt to be secure and will NOT run when it detects a potential security risk (such as no password being set). Despite this, keep in mind that you are opening up your server to be manipulated by anyone who can access the webinterface (i.e. if they find out the password). If you have "execute-any-command" set to TRUE in your config, then any console command can be run from the webinterface.


## Infos for server owners using this

-The port is default 20512, and can be changed in the config
-The password is autogenerated (to not be completely unsafe) and can be found in the config. Change this as soon as you can to something SAFE.

## Infos for developers writing an application using this

-All requests use GET. The parameters that are expected have intuitive names ("password", "player", "reason", "command") and if one of them is missing, the error message will specifically tell you which one.

To access any feature, try to access the URI "the_ip_address:port/featureName", with featureName being:
/ban
/kick
/pardon
/playerlist
/console (for executing arbitrary commands, if enabled)
