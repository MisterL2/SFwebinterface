# SFwebinterface
Web Interface for a SpongeForge Minecraft server, allowing external applications to communicate with the gameserver

# IMPORTANT
As of the time of this writing, the interface has NO AUTHENTICATION and can be used by EVERYONE that knows the Server IP.
Even when there is authentication in place, be aware that opening up your server using this webinterface can allow uninvited guests to run commands on your server.
